"  app failed entirely. excellent wifi, reception new home, needed app send texts home wifi. set account sent 4 messages different contacts -- every message `` failed '' send. conclude pulse sms app fails.",Communication,1,"Pulse is an SMS app. I do not know where you saw that it would send messages over WiFi, but it will not. None of my documentation would have said that your phone will send messages on WiFi alone. That is not the way that SMS apps work and no SMS apps on the Play Store will provide you with that functionality."

Using that app or others, you would lose your messages by resetting your phone. Pulse has a backup system and it is extremely easy to use. If you forgot your password and can't restore your account, that is not the app's fault."

"  app terrible. ability customize ringers, let know message delivered. charged credit card monthly subscription made clear app description. beware",Communication,1,"You can customize ringtones on a global and per-coveraation basis. If your carrier supports delivery reports, there is an option to enable them in settings. You manually signed up for a subscription, the app charged you at the end of the seven day trial. All of this is fully explained in the app and you explicitly signed up for the subscription."
"  missing messages. payed premium version. used watch phone several months. time number instances didnt recieve messages sent never received. got right would great app, messaging app 95 % reliable basic function transmiting messages makes virtually useless. samsung galaxy s8 verizon carrier. pulse states problem could control still makes app unusable",Communication,2,"As a third party app, Pulse has zero control over what is sent or received. Android manages both sides of this process. All that Pulse can do is wait for Android to say there is a new message and hand messages off to Android to be sent. The fault could lie anywhere in the chain of your device, your carrier, the other person's carrier/device."

  uninstalling. people run app bad attitude,Communication,1,"To be clear, you are uninstalling the app, because it prompted you to rate it. I replied to your review explaining that no app can force you to rate it and that the app told you exactly how to skip the rating. I do not know how that is a bad attitude and I am sorry you feel that way."
"  enjoyed app, however stopped sending pictures successfully. switch back-and-forth stock android app send pics. pretty major functionality, one-star degradation. also, reading recent reviews see others issue, found developer defensive, `` also even user issues. third party app plays part reception,. '' ( perhaps, `` third party '' apps figure, well.)",Communication,3,"The stock app on your phone is not a third party app. You can find complaints about MMS on any SMS app on the Play Store. The first topic in the MMS section of my help page has tons of tips around what you can try if MMS are not being sent. You likely just need to lower the max image size, preference. https://messenger.klinkerapps.com/help"

"  warning : app unistalled reinstalled, private conversation saved become exposed! premium pulse account. aside messages configurations settings backed. whats use keeping conversation private someone owner uninstall reinstall app check private messages.",Communication,1,"I'm confused how you would have expected it to work. If you reinstall the app, any settings or configuration you had would be lost, just like any other app on your phone. If you have a Pulse account, it restores the private status with your Pulse account."
"  overall decent app text messaging. like fact ads. go stretch wasnt receiving text anyone. able send receiving. connection good, issues phone service end. spoke phone company thinking end came conclusion investigating app. uninstall reinstall app. uninstalled everything worked fine since. overall decent app though",Communication,3,<NA>
  delete messages samsung s8? deletes pulse app across platforms. sms apps delete locations,Communication,1,"Deleting an entire conversation will delete the messages in the shared database, individual messages will not. Any app will have trade-offs for functionality, this is one of those trade-offs, to use the app across your other devices."
"  worst app ever downloaded expensive! never worked correctly. 3 4 days paying requested money back, never got credit. last year tried load several times see improvements made, none added. missed many messages using app. couple contacts never worked. pictures almost never send receive. would great app worked! waste money!",Communication,1,<NA>
"  app told sent messages never sent. bother ask permission send texts, tell messages sending. caused hassle couple days uninstalled useless, low information app. would give 0 could.",Communication,1,"It asks for permission as the very first thing when you open the app. Unfortunately, as a third party app, Pulse cannot play any part in the sending process. I hand the messages off to Android to be sent, then just wait for their status update. Usually restarting your phone will be enough to update any carrier connections and fix issues around this"
"  app good, lacking must needed features. ( like apps). trustworthy sending receiving mms, go. never know go unless talk receiver. need option back folder external drive device. also needs lock feature lock text get deleted accident.",Communication,2,<NA>
  app worked great started sending random pictures random people. deleted app fear would send personal info. use android messages works much better pulse paid app.,Communication,1,That had nothing to do with Pulse. It was a well known issue with Samsung phones. https://gizmodo.com/a-bug-in-samsungs-default-texting-app-is-sending-random-1827291759
"  limited options sharing texts pictures. share one picture time, group pictures.",Communication,3,You can select as many pictures as you want within Pulse. You aren't limited to one.
"  making app default normal messages stopped. made mobile messaging default otp started. useful app, think tested properly",Communication,2,<NA>
"  saw lot positive reviews, gave try. testing, send messages ( like ones scheduled apps) received. ( edit : mean course messages scheduled sent, otherwise course would received pulse messaging app. using common sense -- end edit). scheduled messages appear eventually pulse, opening old default sms app. also, proces altering default sms app, old messages get lost. luckily made backups beforehand nothing lost. uninstalled looking.",Communication,2,"Pulse is a third party SMS app, it doesn't control what messages are received or when. Android manages all carrier connections. So your common sense just isn't the way things work. Sorry the app isn't for you."
"  love app, interface stuff, aside moment realized ' receiving msgs contacts. tried checking contact blacklist. ended uninstalling app. knows many msgs receive. : (",Communication,3,<NA>
  really like everything app except fact picture messages ever send! user end app shows sent recipient never recives picture. tried many updates hoping fixed nope! seen others complain review issue know phone. developer ever going fix even care. shame good app cant send pictures reliably many supporters look sms app. please fix pacients running!,Communication,1,"I do care. I have a vast section of troubleshooting topics on my help page, specific to MMS. These will fix the issue for 99% of people. Different carriers have different configurations that are required for MMS. There is no single solution. You will also see plenty of reviews saying that MMS works in Pulse, while it doesn't work in other apps."

"  deleting private conversation, starts coming normal conversations list. contact marked private, remain. please improve web app. delete messages. created separate folder chats spam messages, appear normal conversations list. rest, good app overall.",Communication,3,"You can delete messages and conversations from the web app, I don't know what makes you say that. The conversation list is a culmination of all conversations and all folders, conversations will always show there, regardless of what folder you put them in. If you are getting spam messages, you could blacklist that phone number instead."
  install app. phone number secure app. actually great lot robust features. soon installed started receive junk texts attempting get click embedded links. phone number secure app.,Communication,1,"Sorry, but that is not true at all. Everything in Pulse is end-to-end encrypted (https://messenger.klinkerapps.com/encryption.html) and this is my privacy policy (https://messenger.klinkerapps.com/privacy.html)"
  app downloaded viruses pc. told developer already knew. nothing fix.,Communication,2,"I reached out to the virus scanner company that you told me you used, and they said that it was an error on their end and apologized to me. Pulse doesn't have any viruses and I guess that that proves that there was nothing for me to fix."
"  working great months, pops malware. know tell, using pulse message app months morning antivirus flags malware.",Communication,2,"Avast updated their app almost immediately, to resolve this problem. Pulse did not have any viruses, that app was simply mistaken."
  malicious code found app avast,Communication,3,"I don't know what that means, but that is so completely false. Google Play certainly isn't flagging it with anything, so I don't know why you would trust a third party app over Google's own tools."
"  great app. works. constant issues messages sending app, receiving messages seemingly disappeared void, syncing chrome app pc, refresh account. paid months worth frustration. using samsung galaxy s7 chrome app pc mainly.",Communication,2,<NA>
"  missing messages, would use. developer quick respond reviews. +1 point. day tried app 1/3 messages sent displayed phone. never ( knowingly) happened using default sms",Communication,2,"Unfortunately I don't get to control what messages are received. Since there is such tight carrier integration, all that a third party app can do is wait for Android to receive the message. After the system receives the message, it notifies any SMS apps on your phone."
  app showing notifications lying unattended sometime. even app optimise battery mode. useless android messaging app,Communication,2,<NA>
"  seemed like pretty good messenger app, experiencing two issues uninstalled. first thing messages others image attached popping hours days later. someone would send message image one day, received ok time, would receive hours days later. odd. reverted google messenger app stopped happening. saw activity phone attributed pulse notification something decrypted ( even though longer using app). point decided delete.",Communication,3,"There is a specific help topic for what is required if your carrier is delivering multiple MMS messages to you: https://messenger.klinkerapps.com/help. I don't get the same integration that you stock app does. There are only a few steps to go through. If Pulse is on your phone, its still trying to keep up with your messages and will continue to run"

The app is exactly as advertised, all messages are stored completely end to end encrypted in the backend and I have an extensive overview of how that works, on the FAQ section of the web. Not sure why you think that went away, it didn't. And there are definitely no viruses or malware..."
"  security flaw. deleting text messege conversation deleted message still shows list contact conversations. security issue use. app. paid membership hope gets fixed. wasted money - security flaw delete sensitive messages, meant seen. message still displayed, becomes security issue..",Communication,1,"How does that have anything to do with security? The app doesn't have security, Android provides protection from others looking at your phone via the lockscreen, not Pulse. Thanks for the report though, I will fix it."
  good app needs secure log method phone number verification authenticator. tested free paid versions various devices ones without phone numbers assigned. simply entered password able monitor messages.,Communication,3,"Are you asking about two factor authentication? Hopefully in the future that will be possible. It still isn't all that common on the web though, so Pulse isn't out of the ordinary at all, by not using it."
  app continues delete messages. return default messenger app retrieve messages. please fix.,Communication,3,Pulse doesn't automatically delete anything. You can turn off swipe to delete from settings if that's what you are talking about.
